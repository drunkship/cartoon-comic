      <p class="privacyintro">Bamboo makes the most beautiful and tailorable privacy screen. No other option comes close to providing a tall and complete screen instantly. </p>
      <p class="privacyintro">Most zoning restrictions limit fence heights to 5' or 6'. With bamboo you can choose the height of your screen, the fullness, the width and can add color by mixing in some of the more exotic colored bamboos. Thus, bamboo allows you to custom tailor your screen to your site and aesthetic preferences.</p>
      <p class="privacyintro"> To guide your bamboo and prevent its spread to undesired areas, a rhizome barrier 27 inches deep is installed around the perimeter of your hedge area. Best yet, your hedge will stay green year round and does not require expensive trimming and maintenance associated with conventional shrub hedges.</p>

It has a compact growth habit that provides a dense screen and stays within your desired boundaries. The canes are initially green then turn to a reddish wine color that are very smooth and round. </h4>
    <h4>If a faster fill-in is desired, bisetti is a great candidate. It is a vigorous grower. Bisetti has very dark green leaves and grows to about 20 feet. It also grows quite upright, but has more arch than temple bamboo. </h4>
